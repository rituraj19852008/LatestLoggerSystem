# LatestLoggerSystem

Running The Program
In order to run the code you will need to either clone the repository locally or you can download the zip file into whichever directory you prefer and UnZip it.

After this you simply need to cd into LatestLoggerSystem and run the LoggerSystemMainEntryPoint main method passing in the 
filename as the argument to the main method , like this-> --args='src/main/resources/logfile.txt'(May be add it in the VM arguments in the Edit COnfigurations,
if you are using Intellij) which will build and run the program with the log 
file to be parsed being logfile.txt which is a sample file I created based on the example given in the assignment.

In order to run with a different logfile you just need to move the log file into the LatestLoggerSystem directory and replace logfile.txt
with the new file name in the mentioned command or give a relative path to the logfile that you would like to be parsed.

Logging output from the program can be found in LatestLoggerSystemOutputLogs.txt
